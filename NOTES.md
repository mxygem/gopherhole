    * User
    * User stats
    * hints
* Create and store seed for levels when made so that they can be replayed in the future.


## Thoughts/ideas

* Possibly change to check for empty hole and make sure there is at least one other empty hole in the surrounding 8 areas? Currently looking for open spot, then randomly checking in a direction to see if it's in bounds and empty
